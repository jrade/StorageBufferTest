The program tests using storage buffers with graphics pipelines.
The program renders 4 quads (one red, one yellow, one green and one blue).
The programs seems to work with OpenGL, Vulkan and D3D12.
With D3D11 the creation of the pipeline fails with the error message
	Failed to create vertex shader: COM error 0x80070057: The parameter is incorrect.

All testing was done with Windows 11, Visual Studio 2022, Qt 6.9.1.
I tested both with an NVIDIA GeForce and an Intel Iris GPU; the results where the same.

The program can be downloaded from
https://github.com/jrade/StorageBufferTest
It is a Visual Studio 2022 project.
Bake the shaders with Resources/BakeShaders.bat.
Select the RHI backend in Main.cpp.
